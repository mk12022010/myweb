Kamrul Hasan is a professor of Agricultural Extension and Rural Development. His early childhood started in a rural area (Telipara village, Bashtoil, Mirzapur, Tangail). Spending time with friends was remarkable during his study period in Pekua Govt. Primary School (1987-1991) and Bashtoil M. M. High School (1992-1997). As a carrom and chess lover he enjoyed playing with diversified opponents and has earned a number of champion's trophies. Swimming and cycling hobby also makes him nostalgic as he was used to cross rivers by swimming and visit distant tourist attractions with cyclists. Since his HSC (Science group, 1999) at Govt. M. M. Ali College (Tangail), he was almost away from his family that supported his educational expenses until B.Sc.Ag. (Hons.) at Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU, 2005).\n\nStrong mathematical problem-solving capacity opened his way to become a big fan of statistics subject. He started using PC for academic purposes in 2003 and became expert in Microsoft Office programs, operating systems, networking, video and audio editing and statistical software (MSTAT, SPSS) while completing his Master of Science (MS) degree in Agricultural Extension Education (BAU, 2006). Further improvement in using statistical and programming language (R, GAMS, SAS) occurred during his International Master of Science in Rural Development (IMRD, Ghent University, Humboldt University and Slovak University of Agriculture) in Belgium, Germany and Slovakia. Application of machine learning algorithm and econometric analysis using Python and R programming language along with the use of GIS software was flourished in Australia during his PhD in Ecosystem Management (School of Environmental and Rural Science) at the University of New England.\n\nAs a graduate in agricultural sciences, Professor Hasan studied a wide range of subjects related to production, protection, extension, marketing and policy. Environmental Science and Development Economics attracted him while he was in Europe studying under Erasmus Mundus program. His research focused on Climate change, food security and farming systems. He is supervising Master's and PhD students related to such fields of interests. Besides, research his taught courses include Research Methodology, Training Management, Communication, Learning Theories and Methods, Leadership and Groups, Gender Development, and Technology Transfer.\n\nCurrently, Professor Hasan is the Chairman of Agricultural Extension and Rural Development and also worked as the Director of Institutional Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) of Patuakhali Science and Technology University. As a part of this job, he organized and delivered training on quality related topics, e.g., Curriculum Development, National Integrity System, Right to Information, Grievance Redress, Citizen Charter, Public Procurement, and Pedagogy (teaching-learning, active learning, blended learning). He also acts as an active team member for organizing regular extension field tours for undergraduate students.\n\n## Publications\n\n1. Mia, S., Roja, N. T., Sattar, M. A., Ahmed, R., Bhuyan, M.
