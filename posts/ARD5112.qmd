## Introduction to communication

- Communication and human relations skills are currencies in professional and personal life.
- Information is wealth.
- Communication controls human's existence and development.
- By communication one mind affects another.
- Communication is imperative (it controls action).
- Your communication abilities shape your personality.
- Human is a social being because they communicate with each other not because only they live in a society.


## Concept of communication


![](images/communication_simple.png)

- Leagans (1961): Communication is a process by which two or more people exchange ideas, facts, feelings or impressions in ways that each gains a common understanding of the meaning, intent and use of message.
- It is not linear — it’s reciprocal and iterative.
- It involves feed-forward (message sent) and feedback (message received).

## Concept of communication

- Communication is a process by which message is transferred from source to receiver.
- Communication is a process of sending and receiving messages through channels, which establishes common meanings between a source and a receiver.


## Flow of Communication

-   Sender initiates message\
-   Receiver responds with feedback\
-   Shared understanding is the goal

Communication is complete only when mutual understanding is achieved.

## Communication Cycle Example

``` text
Sender: "Hello" (Feed-forward)
Receiver: "Hi!" (Feedback)
```

Feedback makes the process **interactive** and **meaningful**.


## Communication: An Unusual Example

If someone slaps a boy (Feed-forward), and the boy cries (Feedback), **is it communication?**

> **Yes**, this is **non-verbal communication**.
> Even in negative or chaotic situations, **messages are exchanged and feedback occurs**.

## Chaotic or Silent Communication

Conflict, violence, or silence can also be forms of communication.

> Even **no feedback** is a **form of feedback**.

Example: A phone rings but no one answers — we assume they are unavailable.

## Silence and Feedback

Calling someone who doesn’t respond — we interpret that as absence or disinterest.\
A **dead person** cannot provide feedback — this **ends the communication loop**.




## Types of Communication


- **Verbal (~30% by seeing and hearing)**
  - Written
  - Spoken  
  - Interactive (e.g. using device)

- **Non-verbal (~70% by touching, tasting, seeing, smelling)**
  - Posture and gesture
  - Proximity
  - Eye contact and facial expressions
  - Voice tone



## Importance of Communication

- About 70% of our time is spent for communication.
- Present age is called information age.
- Adoption of innovation by farmers
- Solution of problems of farmers
- Create conducive situation for professional development
- Bring desired behavioural changes among farmers
- Social development (infrastructure, values, norms, culture)
- Effective communication improves trust, cooperation, conflict resolution, teamwork and collaboration


## Communication and human behavior

Communication builds **human relationships** through:

-   Persuasion
-   Negotiation
-   Diplomacy
-   Dispute resolution


## Elements of Communication

Five elements of communication:

- Source/communicator/sender
- Message  
- Channel
- Receiver/audience/respondent  
- Feedback



## Elements - Source

**Communicator/source/sender**

- Communicator acts as an originator of the message
- They start the communication process
- Task of a communicator ⇒ message selection and treatment
- Homophilous source and receiver enjoy comfort in communication
- Homophilous means similar in beliefs, values, education, social status, etc.



## Qualities of a Good Communicator

- **Knowledge level:** Must know the message, objectives, needs, audience aspiration
- **Faith of the receiver:** More credible source leads to greater acceptance
- **Interest:** Adequate efforts and devotion to communicate the message
- **Communication skill:** Efficient message selection and treatment




## Qualities (Continued)

- **Language and culture:** Compatible language helps proper treatment and interpretation
- **Attitude and presentation:** Positive attitude towards message and receiver
  - Avoid: Inattention, vocabulary differences, poor pronunciation, poor articulation, plural meanings, improper association
  

## Qualities (Continued)

- **Message treatment:**
  - Handle message to make it clear, understandable and realistic
  - Organized and logically arranged message gets better reception
  - Understand the audience for proper treatment
  - Message must be treated for the audience, not for the communicator
  - Emotional/rational appeals for literate farmers; fear appeal/inductive order for illiterate farmers



## Elements - Message

- Important information communicated by the source
- Good message makes individual feel a need that can be satisfied by action
- Should be valid, unambiguous, comprehensive and of utility
- Valid message comes from credible source and conforms with intentions



## Criteria of a Good Message

- Communicableness - easy to communicate
- Less social and economic risk  
- Aligned with beliefs, values and economic capabilities
- Simple - easy to understand and practice
- Divisibility - permits small scale trial before full adoption
- Relative advantage - higher benefits than existing
- Accuracy - relevancy and suitability well-tested under local conditions



## Elements - Channel

- Medium or vehicle which carries the message
- Physical bridge between source and receiver
- Extension teaching methods are communication channels
- Person, mobile phone, newspaper, radio are examples
- Must be used in right way, right time, for right actions with right audience
- Can be local or cosmopolitan, and interpersonal, group or mass
- Early adopters use mass communication; late majority uses interpersonal channels



## Criteria for Selecting Communication Channel

- **Availability** - Locally available, common and familiar
- **Cost** - Simple, cheap and easy to obtain and handle
- **Preference of communicator** - Must be skilled in using selected channels
- **Suitable content and receiver** - Receiver should understand message and use channels
- **Frequency of use** - Repetition enhances acceptability; multiple channels in parallel works better
- **Effectiveness** - Should effectively bring together sender and receiver
- **Nearly extinct local media** - e.g. roving bards, minstrels, theatres can be used



## Elements - Audience

Receiver of the message (men, women, village leaders, farmers, etc.)

Factors affecting desirable response:

- **Needs** - Should be studied before initiating communication
- **Knowledge level** - Deliver message considering receiver's knowledge
- **Attitude** - Form favorable attitude; message decoding depends on attitude



## Audience (Continued)

- **Available resources** - Message actions need resources; align with available resources
- **Socio-cultural systems** - Message should be compatible with social systems
- **Experience** - New learning built upon previous experience; satisfactory experience leads to fast learning



## Elements - Feedback

- Reaction given by receivers in response to message
- Return process where receiver acts as source
- Communication process ⇒ feed forward and feedback backward
- Self-communication: message encoded is fed back into system by decoding
- **Action - Reaction** interdependence is feedback
- Both sender and receiver can encode and decode simultaneously


## Elements - Feedback (cont'd)

- Provides source information about success in accomplishing objectives
- Controls encoding of next messages
- Feedback can be: 
  - Intentional (e.g., nodding to show understanding) 
  - Unintentional (e.g., yawning from boredom)


## Feedback examples

- A student raising hand = intentional
- Looking distracted = unintentional


## Importance of Feedback

- Clarify message - Feedback helps adjust or clarify the message
- Removes barriers - source can learn adoption barriers
- Facilitates proper action - to make message understandable
- Rectifies transmission errors - identifies channel noise to minimize
- Increases accuracy - reduces message distortion, improves adoption


## Importance of Feedback (cont'd)
- Enhances confidence - improves rapport between source and receiver
- Improves learning - both active and passive feedback enhances knowledge
- Improves communication - rewarding feedback results in continued adoption



## Problems in Getting Feedback

- Limitation of the channel
- Shyness of the receiver
- Discouraging by the communicator
- Socio-economic barriers
- Untimely message
- Language and cultural barriers



# Analysis of communication models

## Definition of Communication Model

- **Model:** Miniature (drawings, charts, diagrams) of complex process to show relationships, flows, structures
- Help simplify complex ideas for teaching and evaluation
- Offer organised way of looking at complex process
- Should show all important elements with minimal text
- **Models:** Berlo (1960), Shannon-Weaver (1949), Leagans (1963), Rogers and Shoemaker (1971)


## Models of Communication

- **Action/linear/one-way Model** – One-way transmission (e.g., TV broadcast, Shannon-Weaver's model, Berlo's model)

- **Interactive/two-way Model** – Sender ↔︎ Receiver with feedback (e.g. News blog, Rogers and Shoemaker's model, Leagan's model)

- **Transactional or interpersonal Model** – Both parties simultaneously sender and receiver (e.g. Interview, Barlund's Model, mindful model)

Modern communication favors transactional, real-time exchange — especially in interpersonal and professional settings.

Mindless communication: distraction, e.g. scrolling smartphone while listening.


## Typical Communication Model (M. K. Hasan)

![](images/typical-communication-model.png)




## Noise/Disruption in Communication

Communication cycle disrupted by noise due to:

**Internal causes**
- Physiological: Hunger, fatigue, discomfort
- Psychological: Good or bad emotion or feelings  
- Semantic: Meanings of words or symbols not matching

**External causes:** Noisy room, temperature extremes, broken devices, distractions

**Notes:**
- Encode ⇒ organization of information as message
- Message ⇒ encoded information  
- Decode ⇒ interpretation of message



## Causes of Noise in Communication

1. **Failure of channel to reach intended audience** - not all attend meetings or access mass media
2. **Failure to handle channels skillfully** - not everyone may hear message in meeting
3. **Failure to select appropriate channels** - wrong method for objectives
4. **Failure to use channels according to audience abilities** - written materials for illiterate
5. **Failure to avoid physical distraction** - moving people, noise, heat, lighting, crowdedness



## Causes of Noise (Continued)

6. **Failure of audience to listen/look carefully** - undivided attention needed
7. **Failure to use enough channels in parallel** - 5-6 channels may be needed for impact
8. **Use of too many channels in series** - More channels in series increases distortion risk

Good communicator should identify and eliminate sources of communication noise



## How to Minimize Channel Noise

Use channels based on:
1. Specific objectives of message
2. Nature of message - direct vs abstract, difficulty, scope, timing
3. Audience - size, need, interest, knowledge
4. Availability of channels and logistic support
5. Combination of channels - parallel vs series
6. Relative cost of channels
7. Time available of audience and communicator
8. Nature of channels - seeing, hearing, or doing
9. Extent of cumulative effects of message
10. Skills of communicator



# Source Credibility

## Concepts of source credibility

- Acceptance depends partly on "who said it"
- Set of perceptions about sources held by receivers
- Includes competence and trustworthiness
- May include: age, education, sex, language, ideology, socioeconomic status, etc.

## Dimensions of source credibility

1. **Safety:** Trustworthiness, kind, friendly, honest, just, dependable
2. **Qualifications:** Expertness, experience, knowledge, skilled, communicability
3. **Dynamisms:** Active, energetic, emphatic, fast, frank, bold
4. **Sociability:** Gentle, accommodative, approachable, hospitable, attractive, pleasant



## Importance of Source Credibility

In persuasive communication, vital role in message acceptance

**Impacts:**
- Participation in meeting - better/poor
- Attention of audience - sufficient/inadequate  
- Message acceptance - low/high
- Implementation of message - desired/undesired
- Feedback of audience - affects understanding

Personal cosmopolite sources perceived as more credible than mass media


# Message Management

## Characteristics of a Message

- Technology orderly organized and encoded for information, instruction or persuasion
- Recommendations/contents affecting socioeconomic life

**Characteristics:**
1. Relevant to objective
2. Clearly understandable
3. Aligned with mental, social, economic, physical capabilities
4. Socially and economically significant
5. Specific - no irrelevant material



## Characteristics (Continued)

6. Simply stated
7. Accurate and scientifically valid
8. Timely in relation to practice
9. Appropriate to channel used
10. Appealing and attractive
11. Applicable to user system
12. Adequate and complete
13. Manageable by source and receiver
14. Persuasive - affects affective domain for changes



## Treatment of a Message

- Encoding message to make it understandable for desired feedback
- Necessary to carry intended meaning
- Organized message produces more comprehension and retention
- Disorganized message may foil communication functions

For effective persuasion:
- (A) Pattern of organization
- (B) Ordering of arguments  
- (C) Nature of arguments
- (D) Message style



## A. Pattern of Organization

1. **Space Pattern** - geographical order (e.g. AEZ, soil tracts)
2. **Time order** - historical perspective (e.g. Agricultural development)
3. **Deductive order** - general to specific (e.g. role of communication)
4. **Inductive order** - specific to general (e.g. impact of compost use)
5. **Psychological order** - based on attitude, need, satisfaction, visualization, action
6. **Problem-solving order** - cultivation process
7. **Climax order** - key points at end
8. **Anticlimax order** - key points at beginning  
9. **Pyramidical order** - key points at middle



## B. Ordering of Arguments

**Agreeable vs disagreeable parts**
- Agreeable parts at beginning draw attention (pleasant materials help persuasion)
- Disagreeable parts at beginning can deter audience, causing avoidance



### C. Nature of Arguments

**One-sided vs two-sided message**
- Limiting disfavourable parts suitable for illiterate audience
- Example: Family planning helps welfare (favourable) but may contradict religion (disfavourable)
- Two-sided message more effective with higher education receivers



## D. Message Style

1. **Message repetition** - Increases awareness but continued repetition may cause boredom
2. **Message comprehension** - Receivers must understand to accept; correlated with agreement/retention
3. **Source evaluation** - Communicator evaluated based on message contents affecting credibility



## Message Appeals

Psychological features that invoke feelings

**1. Fear appeal**
- Creates threats affecting affective/cognitive domains to motivate behavior change
- Example: Get vaccinated because cholera epidemic causing 90% death
- Principle: Uncomfortable drive state motivates action to minimize/remove it
- Moderate fear effective; higher level causes anxiety and confusion


## Message Appeals (Continued)

**2. Reward appeal**
- Message organized with possible benefits from innovation
- Blended with relative merits/advantages
- Example: Binashail vs Nazirshail - taller plants, 20% higher yield, earlier maturity, better recovery, rainfed cultivation, high demand
- **Conclusion drawing:** Explicit conclusions by source more effective than implicit by receivers

## Message Appeals (Continued)

**3. Emotional appeal**
- 'Pathos' appeals creating appropriate feeling using values/emotions
- Argue for belief by pointing out rewards from holding belief
- Example: Clean homestead for safe environment for kids/parents
- Example: Bangabandhu's speech on 7 March 1971



## Message Appeals (Continued)

**4. Rational appeal**
- 'Logos' appeals presenting empirical/logical evidence
- Result demonstration is rational appeal
- Emotional and rational appeals often complementary
- Emotional for politicians; rational for elite/educated voters
- Association with known facts, visual elements, non-verbal cues works well



## Message Reception - 'Selective'/'Partial'

- Process of exposure/attention, perception and retention
- Effects depend on attention, learning, and perception as intended
- Audience reaction explained by selective exposure, perception, retention
- People attend to **(selective exposure)**, understand **(selective perception)**, remember **(selective retention)** parts supportive of existing knowledge/attitude/beliefs
- Knowledge-gap hypothesis: Farmers with better knowledge have better attention/perception/retention



## Source Evaluating Variables of Message

1. **Listenibility/readability** - Economy of words; short active sentences (8-10 words); short words
2. **Human interest** - Related to receivers
3. **Vocabulary diversity** - Avoid repetition in formal/informal communication
4. **Realism** - Empirical message more accepted than abstract
5. **Verifiability** - Property of being scientifically tested



# Level and Pattern of Communication

## Three Types of Communication

- **Interpersonal:** Communicator meets individual audience (face-to-face, meeting, visit, letter, phone, video call)
- **Group:** Communicator reaches group with known identities (group discussion, method demonstration)  
- **Mass:** Communicator reaches large number with unknown identities (mass gathering, radio, TV, newspaper)

**Intrapersonal communication:** Communicating with onself

**Persuasive communication:** Art to convince using skills, credible source, convincing arguments, relevance



## Inerpersonal Communication

- Non-verbal cues vital in interpersonal, classroom, group, mass communication
- Non-verbal can be stronger than verbal
- Strong skills needed in personal/professional life
- In business: speak clearly/confidently to build rapport/convince
- Conflicts are common in interpersonal communication


## Guidelines for Interpersonal Communication

- Professionals should follow guidelines in all audience settings
- Some inherently expert; others need to learn guidelines
- Strong skills needed in personal/professional life
- In business: speak clearly/confidently to build rapport/convince
