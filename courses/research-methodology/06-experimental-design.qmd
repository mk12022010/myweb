## Essential Components

1. **Randomization**: Treatments assigned randomly to experimental units
2. **Replication**: Identical treatments applied to multiple units
3. **Local Control**: Maintaining homogeneity among experimental units

## Types of Experimental Designs

### 1. Pre-experimental Designs
- One group post-test design
- One group pretest-post-test design
- Static group comparison design

### 2. True Experimental Designs
- Post-test control group design (RCT)
- Pretest-post-test control group design

### 3. Quasi-experimental Designs
- Non-equivalent control group design
- Interrupted time series design

## Agricultural Experimental Designs

1. **CRD (Completely Randomized Design)**: Homogeneous field, random treatment assignment
2. **RCBD (Randomized Complete Block Design)**: Field heterogeneous in one direction
3. **LSD (Latin Square Design)**: Field heterogeneous in both directions
4. **Factorial Design**: Two factors, both easy to manage
5. **Split-plot Design**: Two factors, one easy and one difficult to manage
