title: "Hypothesis Testing"
---

## Hypothesis Characteristics

- States expected relationship between variables
- Testable with operationally defined variables
- Clear implications for testing
- Consistent with existing knowledge

## Types of Hypotheses

1. **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: No relationship
2. **Research Hypothesis (Hₐ)**: Expected relationship
   - Directional: Specifies direction
   - Non-directional: No direction specified

## Testing Process

1. Set significance level (α, typically 0.05)
2. Calculate test statistic
3. Compare to critical value
4. Decide to reject/retain H₀

## Errors in Testing

| Decision   | H₀ True          | H₀ False         |
|------------|------------------|------------------|
| Reject H₀  | Type I Error     | Correct Decision |
| Retain H₀  | Correct Decision | Type II Error    |

- Type I: False positive (more dangerous in medical tests)
- Type II: False negative (more dangerous in agricultural research)
