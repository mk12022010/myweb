## Understanding Research Problems

A research problem is a specific issue, difficulty, contradiction, or gap in knowledge that a researcher aims to address through systematic investigation. It is the foundation of any research project, guiding the direction of study and focusing efforts on finding solutions or answers.

### Characteristics of a Good Research Problem

A research problem should:
- Not be too vague (e.g., "effect of climate change on agriculture")
- Not be too narrow (e.g., "name of the first president of Malaysia")
- Have novelty (has not been done before)
- Be consistent with previous research

### Importance of Research Problems

1. **Guides the Research Process**: Provides clear direction for formulating research questions and objectives.
2. **Determines Research Design**: Influences the choice of research design and methods.
3. **Ensures Relevance**: Addresses real-world issues or gaps in knowledge.
4. **Facilitates Resource Allocation**: Helps optimize time, funding, and other resources.
5. **Enhances Research Quality**: Maintains study rigor and coherence.

## Identifying Research Problems

1. **Literature Review**: Identify gaps, inconsistencies, and unresolved questions.
2. **Practical Observations**: Reveal pressing issues through real-world engagement.
3. **Expert Consultation**: Gain insights from experienced professionals.
4. **Previous Research**: Analyze findings from earlier studies.
5. **Policy Analysis**: Review policies to uncover evaluation needs.

### Example: Agricultural Extension Research Problem

**Context**: Agricultural extension services in Bangladesh aim to improve farmer productivity.

**Identified Problem**: "What are the key barriers to the adoption of modern agricultural practices among smallholder farmers in Bangladesh, and how can agricultural extension services be improved to address these barriers?"
