---

## Key Concepts

- **Population**: Entire group of interest
- **Sample**: Subset of population selected for study

## Sampling Techniques

### Probability Sampling:
1. Simple random sampling
2. Systematic random sampling
3. Stratified sampling
4. Cluster sampling
5. Multi-stage sampling

### Non-probability Sampling:
1. Convenience sampling
2. Purposive sampling
3. Snowball sampling
4. Quota sampling

## Sample Size Determination

Factors affecting sample size:
- Population variability
- Desired precision
- Confidence level
- Sampling method

Use formula:  
`n = (Z² × p × q) / e²`  
Where:  
Z = Z-score (1.96 for 95% CI)  
p = estimated proportion  
q = 1-p  
e = margin of error
