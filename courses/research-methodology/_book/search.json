    "text": "2.2 Knowledge, Science, Technology, Research\n\nKnowledge is the stored information in our brain, books or internet that can be recalled when needed. If we cannot recall or retrieve the information that is not considered as knowledge. Knowledge can be gathered randomly from anywhere and by any means. However, if the knowledge is generated using systematic process (problem identification, data collection, analysis and interpretation) then this systematic knowledge is called science. Science is seen through its invention (device - pen, idea - planting date, or practice - row planting), which is called technology. When a technology is perceived as being new to an individual, the technology is termed as innovation (new technology).\nResearch is the process of generating the knowledge, i.e. the systematic process by which knowledge or technology is generated, in other words, a problem is solved. This process has to be reproducible. It is a systematic progress from the known to the unknown. Research is a crucial tool for making adjustment to the ever changing situation of our universe."

This is more participatory than applied research.\nBehavioral research: Behavioral research is a scientific field that investigates the actions and interactions of individuals and groups. It seeks to understand, describe, and predict behavior through systematic observation, experimentation, and analysis."
