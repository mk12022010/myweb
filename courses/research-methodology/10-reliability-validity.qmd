title: "Reliability and Validity"
---

## Reliability

Consistency or reproducibility of scores. Estimation methods:

1. **Test-retest**: Same test at two time points
2. **Parallel-forms**: Equivalent forms of test
3. **Inter-rater**: Consistency between raters
4. **Internal consistency**: Cronbach's alpha (>0.7 acceptable)

## Validity

Accuracy in measuring what it claims to measure. Types:

1. **Content Validity**: Expert judgment of coverage
2. **Face Validity**: Superficial appearance
3. **Criterion Validity**: Correlation with criterion
   - Concurrent: Simultaneous measures
   - Predictive: Future outcomes
4. **Construct Validity**: Theoretical constructs
   - Convergent: Related measures correlate
   - Discriminant: Unrelated measures don't correlate

## Measurement Errors

- High bias, high variance: Neither reliable nor valid
- Low variance, low bias: Reliable and valid
