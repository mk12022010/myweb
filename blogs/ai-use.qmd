# AI in research

Using AI in academic writing and research [@khalifa2024]: 

- Idea generation and conceptualization
- Content structuring
- Literature review and synthesis
- Research design and methodology
- Data management including visualization
- Editing and grammar corrections
- Reference management



# The paradigm shift: AI generation

> "AI cannot replace your critical thinking; it is a powerful assistance for speeding up your prepared mind."

-   **Supportive, not replacement:** AI enhances researcher capability.
-   **Speed vs. depth:** Accelerates tedious tasks, provides time for deep analysis and interpretation.
-   **New skill required:** "Prompt Engineering" is a core AI use competency. **How to prompt?**



## How Do AI Language Models Work? {.smaller1}

**Critical users should be aware of [@ibm2025]:**

- **AI Models:** Predictive Text Generation using Machine Learning algorithms (e.g., deep neural network, which is a statistical model)
- **They are not collection** of all facts or knowledge.
- **They are statistical prediction tools** trained on large amounts of text data.
- **Fundamental task:** Given a sequence of words or phrase (**the prompt**), predict the next word or phrase based on probability.


## AI Training Process (Simplified)

```


# AI in Problem Identification and Conceptualization

## Tools: ChatGPT-4, Claude, Elicit, Scispace

-   **Brainstorming Research Questions:**
    -   *Prompt:* "Give me 5 novel research questions on the linkage between climate-smart agriculture adoption and social capital in coastal Bangladesh."
-   **Identifying Gaps:**
    -   *Prompt:* "Summarize the major theories used to explain technology adoption in rural sociology. Mention which are least applied in an agricultural context."
-   **Developing a Conceptual Framework:**
    -   *Prompt:* "Based on the Theory of Planned Behavior, provide me a draft conceptual framework model for analyzing farmers' intention to use drought-resistant varieties."



# AI in Research Design and Methodology Selection

## Tools: ChatGPT-4, Julius AI, Deepseek, Gemini {.smaller1}

-   **Choosing Statistical Tests:** *Prompt:* "My research question is: 'Does training (yes/no) have effects on knowledge scores (continuous) and adoption levels (ordinal: low, medium, high) among farmers? What are the appropriate statistical tests?'"
-   **Survey Design:** *Prompt:* "Draft a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire to measure 'perceived behavioural control' based on the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) for farmers using organic fertilizers and manure." [Note: TPB $\Rightarrow$ Attitude + Norms + Beliefs in Ability]
-   **Sample Size Calculation:** *Prompt:* "My population is 15000. What could be the sample size with 95% confidence interval and 5% margin of error, using @hasan2024 formula. Also provide the values for different parameters in the formula, e.g. sample control ratio".



# AI in Literature Reviews

## Tools: Elicit, Scite

-   **Elicit:** Uses AI to find and summarize top published articles. **Best for initial search.** 
    -   *Task:* Find top cited papers on "diffusion of innovations in agriculture."
<br>
-   **Scite:** Shows citations of published articles (e.g., as supporting or contradicting findings). 
    -   *Task:* Check if a key theory paper that has been widely cited.
  

## Tools: Research Rabbit, Litmaps, Scispace

-   **Research Rabbit and Litmaps:** Creates visualization and maps of the literature based on citation that help find key papers of interest.
-   **Scispace:** For writing research tasks.

> **Crucial:** These tools assist in *finding* literature. The *synthesis* and *critical analysis* must be done by you.



# AI in Manuscript Writing and Paraphrasing

## Remember: AI is an Assistant, Not an Author  {.smaller1}

-   **Overcoming Writer's Limitation:**
    -   *Prompt:* "Write a paragraph for the 'methodology' chapter of a PhD thesis explaining a multistage random sampling technique for a survey in coastal areas of Bangladesh."
-   **Improving Clarity:**
    -   *Prompt:* "Rewrite this sentence for better clarity and brevity: [Paste your haphazard sentences.]"
-   **Paraphrasing & Grammar:**
    -   **Tools:** Grammarly, Wordtune, QuillBot.
    -   **Goal:** To polish *your own writing*, not to generate original content.



## Responsible Paraphrasing

<br>
```{mermaid}
%%| echo: false
%%{init: {'themeVariables': { 'fontSize': '2rem'}}}%%
graph LR
A[Human<br>Sentences] --> B[AI<br>Praphrasing]
B --> C[Human<br>Editing</editing>]
C --> D[AI<br>grammar<br>check]
```

```{mermaid}
%%| echo: false
%%{init: {'themeVariables': { 'fontSize': '2rem'}}}%%
graph LR
A[AI<br>Generated Texts] --> B[AI<br>Praphrasing]
B --> C[Human<br>Paraphrasing</editing>]
C --> D[AI<br>grammar<br>check]
```

<br>
**Unethical use**

```{mermaid}
%%| echo: false
%%{init: {'themeVariables': { 'fontSize': '2rem'}}}%%
graph LR
A[AI<br>Generated Texts] --> B[AI<br>Praphrasing]
B --> C[Published<br>Article]
```


## Example: Responsible Paraphrasing {.smaller2}

**Original (Human-Written) Sentence:**

> "The adoption of new agricultural technologies is contingent upon a complex interplay of socioeconomic factors, extension service accessibility, and perceived risk among the farming community."

**AI-Assisted Paraphrase (using Quilbot/Hixbypass/Wordtune/Grammarly Suggestion):**

> "The uptake of novel agricultural technologies depends on a complex combination of socioeconomic conditions, access to extension services, and farmers' perception of risk."

**Why it is responsible?** The *idea* and *core content* are of the researcher. The AI has only helped with *word choice* and *sentence fluency*.


## Example: Responsible Paraphrasing {.smaller2}

**AI-Generated Text:**

> "The uptake of novel agricultural technologies depends on a complex combination of socioeconomic conditions, access to extension services, and farmers' perception of risk."

**Human Paraphrase after checking the sources:**

> "The adoption of agricultural innovations depends on a complex set of socioeconomic attributes, access to extension services, and farmers' perception of risk."


**Why it is responsible?** The AI has generated the texts. The author has checked the sources and found ok followed by paraphrasing aligned with the standard format for publication.



## Example: Unethical Use of AI {.smaller2}

**AI-Written sentence:**

> "The uptake of novel agricultural technologies depends on a complex combination of socioeconomic conditions, access to extension services, and farmers' perception of risk."

**Used in article as it is:**

> "The uptake of novel agricultural technologies depends on a complex combination of socioeconomic conditions, access to extension services, and farmers' perception of risk."


**Why it is not responsible:** The *idea* and *core content* are generated by the AI. The researchers has not used their own idea or ideas based on published literature.


# AI in Data Analysis and Visualization

## Improving statistical analysis {.smaller1}

-   **Code Generation & Explanation:**
    -   *Tool:* ChatGPT-4 (Code Interpreter), GitHub Copilot.
    -   *Prompt:* "Write R code to run a multiple linear regression with `yield` as the dependent variable and `rainfall`, `fertilizer`, and `training` as independent variables. Include code to check for multicollinearity using VIF."
-   **Error Debugging:**
    -   *Prompt:* "I get this error in my Python code `ValueError: shapes (100,5) and (3,) not aligned`. What does it mean and how do I fix it?"

**Principle:** You must know and understand the appropriate statistics. AI helps with the *implementation*, not the *conceptualization*.



## Example: AI for data visualization

**Researcher's goal:** Visualize the difference in mean yields between conventional and new practices.

<br>

**Initial R code (researcher's draft):**

```r
ggplot(data, aes(practice, yield)) + geom_boxplot()
```

<br>

-   **Visualization enhancement:**

    -   *Tool:* ChatGPT-4, Deepseek.
    -   *Prompt:* "Suggest improvements for this ggplot2 code to make this scatterplot more publication-ready. [Paste your code]"


## For Conceptual Diagrams and Illustrations

-   **Midjourney, DALL-E 3, Stable Diffusion, Davinci.ai:**
    -   **Use case:** Creating original artwork, conceptual diagrams, illustrative figures that are not based on real data.
    -   **Example prompt for a conceptual diagram:** "A minimalist, professional scientific illustration of the 'research methodology' as a cycle with icons for 'problem identification', 'data collection', 'analysis', and 'interpretation'. White background, blue and green colors, vector style."
    -   **Critical consideration:** These tools **must not** be used to generate or alter experimental data, photographs, maps, or graphs that represent research findings. **This is a serious violation of academic integrity.**



## Ethical Notes on AI Images

> **AI should not generate your *data*, but it can generate your *diagrams*.**

-   **Permissible:** Creating a flow chart of your research process.
-   **Permissible:** Generating an icon to represent "agricultural extension" in a presentation slide.
-   **Fraudulent:** Generating a picture of a plant with a disease symptom for your research.
-   **Fraudulent:** Creating a fake graph or map with fictional data points.


## Ethical Notes on AI Images (cont'd)

<br>

**Always disclose the use of AI for image generation in your figure captions.**

<br>

*Example Caption:* 

"Figure 1: Research conceptual framework. AI-generated image created using Midjourney (v6.0) based on prompts by the authors."


## Making Writing "AI-Free" {.smaller2}

1.  **Write your first draft manually.** This is your original intellectual contribution.
2.  **Use AI for editing.** Input your text into Grammarly/ Wordtune/ Quilbot/ Hixbypass for grammar, spelling, and clarity suggestions.
3.  **Manually review every change.** Do not accept all changes. Critically check each suggestion. Does it change your intended meaning?
4.  **Use AI for phrasing help.** If struggle with a single sentence, ask for alternatives, but then rewrite it in your own words based on the the alternative suggestions.
5.  **Final Read-Through:** Read the entire document aloud to ensure it sounds like your voice.

**Output:** A polished manuscript that is authentically yours.



# Reference Management

## Tools: Zotero, Mendeley {.smaller1}

-   **Automatic:** These tools can automatically retrieve metadata (title, author, journal, DOI) from uploaded PDFs.
-   **Word Processors Plugins:** The plugins for Word/Google Docs are used to seamlessly integrate with RStudio and Word processors.
-   **Best Practice:** Double-check the auto-extracted data against the original PDF. Errors related to reference formating especially author names, capitalization and missing elements are highly common!
-   **Take Care**: Double check the formats of direct and indirect in-text citations, e.g. Author (year) or (author, year).
-   **CSL:** Download required citation style language (.csl) file from [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/styles)/[Mendeley](https://csl.mendeley.com/about/) repositories.


# Ethical principles

Most top university and journal guidelines [@oxford2025; @springer2023] are built on:

1. **Authorship:** AI cannot be your co-author!
2.  **Transparency and disclosure:** Always disclose the use of AI during publication.
3.  **Accountability:** The researcher is ultimately responsible for all content.
4.  **Validity and integrity:** Never trust AI output blindly; always verify.


## Ethical principles (cont'd)

5.  **Privacy and confidentiality:** Never input sensitive, proprietary, or personal data.
6.  **Fairness:** Be aware of and mitigate algorithmic biases.
7.  **Security risk:** Be cuatious about AI bots to minimize security risks and fishing.

> **Your responsibility:** *Always check guidelines and policies of the university or journals of your interest.*


## Disclosure Statement: Thesis/Manuscript/Article

**A recommended statement for methods or acknowledgements section:**

> "During the preparation of this work, the author(s) used [List of Tools, e.g., ChatGPT-4, Elicit, Grammarly] to [List of Purposes, e.g., generate initial ideas for research questions, improve language clarity, and paraphrase the author's original writing]. After using these tools/services, the author(s) reviewed and edited the content as needed and take(s) full responsibility for the content of the publication."




## Skills needed for using AI in research

- **Prompt:** Get what you need by using appropriate prompt.
- **Accept responsibility:**  You are the author. Never blame AI for the contents.
- **Acknowledge AI:** This is ethical compliance that you declare the use of AI.
- **Paraphrase:** Making writing plagiarism and AI-free by using your own thinking; not only other AI tools for paraphrasing.

> Human input is required in every step for responsible and ethical use of AI in research.


# Danger: Risks of AI in Knowledge and Science {.smaller2}

> **Don't think a person is interacting with you**. Hold your reign before you collapse.

- **Plagiarism and lack of originality** in academic writing  
- **Fake data and references** generated by AI tools that can confidently misguide or mislead you to a deadend.  
- **Superficial knowledge**, polished text without depth  
- **Loss of critical thinking** among researchers and young generations
- **Misinformation and deepfakes** undermining trust by producing fake audio/videos


## Biggest outputs of research

Using systematized approach, research:

- **Generates new knowledge**
- Provides idea, practice, or device
- Results in innovation or technology


## Biggest weaknesses of AI

- Statistical machine learning models that use existing information
- **AI does not generate new knowledge**; it only recycles knowledge
- So, full dependency on AI is a dead end of research and scientific progress
- However, AI provides efficient solutions that are based on existing information, e.g. diagnostic task, security, office management, auto-driving, auto-piloting, decision-making, deep analysis of information, programming, app and software development and many others.


# Looking Beyond AI {.smaller1}

**SI: Synthetic Intelligence, @pittman2018**. Alreadey started by famous.ai 

- AI: 
  - Does not generate new knowledge
  - Recycles the existing knowledge
  - Simulated/mimicking intelligence
<br>
- SI:
  - Genuine non-human intelligence, not just an imitation of human
  - Autonomous intelligence, 
  - Advanced, self-controlled, can add intermediate actions
  - Involves building physical brain-like devices
