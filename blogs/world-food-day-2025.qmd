## Introduction

- Do you know how many people are dying of hunger right now?
- Between 7,700 and over 20,000 people die every day from hunger-related causes.
- That is roughly 10 every minute (Oxfam, 2024).

---

## Plenty-Share Paradox

- The world produces enough food to feed everyone, yet millions still starve.
- Global food output meets 2.5 times the caloric needs, but unfair distribution, conflict, and waste lead to ongoing hunger.

---

## Bangladesh Reality

- Bangladesh produces enough rice for its needs, but it struggles with malnutrition and food insecurity.
- Approximately 17% of the population is food-insecure, particularly in coastal regions. Climate stress and market inequalities make the situation worse.

---

## Major Causes of Hunger

- Inequitable Distribution, unequal access to markets and resources (Benassai‑Dalmau et al., 2025).
- Food Loss and Waste, 21 million tonnes lost annually (CPD, 2024).
- Climate and Conflict Impacts, extreme weather, price volatility, and displacement (Oxfam, 2024).

---

## Rethinking Solutions

Food security = Production × Access × Equity × Sustainability.

**Solutions:**

- Social safety nets and nutrition-sensitive agriculture.
- Local food systems and short value chains.
- Investment in post-harvest management and youth innovation.

---

## Collaboration for Equity

- **National:** fair markets, subsidies, inclusive land policies.
- **Local:** link cooperatives, women’s groups, and markets.
- **Multi-sector:** universities, NGOs, and government coordination for resilient systems.

---

## Youth as Change Catalysts

- Youth networks bridge innovation and field needs.
- Promote agri-digital tools, climate-smart practices, entrepreneurship.
- Showcase local startups and youth-led agrifood initiatives.

---

## Vision for a Resilient Future

“Food security will not come from producing more, but from sharing better.”

**Action Steps:**

- Integrate equity in food policy.
- Build trust-based partnerships.
- Empower youth and communities.

## Conclusion

“If you cannot feed a hundred people, then feed just one.” — Mother Teresa

Collective humanity defines our food future.
