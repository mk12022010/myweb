# Outline

1.  Concept
2.  Types
3.  Elements
4.  Uses

# Introduction {#introduction}

**Did you know?**

-   We spend around **70%** of our time in some form of communication (listening, speaking, reading, writing). Most researchers agree it's between **60%–80%**, with **listening** alone taking \~45%.
-   Communication and human relations skills are currencies in professional and personal life.

# Importance of Communication

Effective communication builds:

-   Trust
-   Cooperation
-   Conflict resolution
-   Teamwork and collaboration

# Concept of Communication {#concept-of-communication}

-   Communication is the **exchange of messages** between a **source** (sender) and a **receiver** (audience).
-   It is not linear — it's **reciprocal and iterative**.
-   It involves **feed-forward** (message sent) and **feedback** (message received).

# ![](images/typical-communication-model.png)

# Flow of Communication

-   Sender initiates message\
-   Receiver responds with feedback\
-   Shared understanding is the goal

Communication is complete only when mutual understanding is achieved.

# Communication Cycle Example {#communication-cycle-example}

``` text
Sender: "Hello" (Feed-forward)
Receiver: "Hi!" (Feedback)
```

Feedback makes the process **interactive** and **meaningful**.

# Communication: An Unusual Example {#communication-an-unusual-example}

If someone slaps a boy (Feed-forward), and the boy cries (Feedback), **is it communication?**

> **Yes**, this is **non-verbal communication**.
> Even in negative or chaotic situations, **messages are exchanged and feedback occurs**.

# Chaotic or Silent Communication

Conflict, violence, or silence can also be forms of communication.

> Even **no feedback** is a **form of feedback**.

Example: A phone rings but no one answers — we assume they are unavailable.

# Silence and Feedback {#silence-and-feedback}

Calling someone who doesn’t respond — we interpret that as absence or disinterest.\
A **dead person** cannot provide feedback — this **ends the communication loop**.

# Types of Communication {#types-of-communication}

**Verbal Communication** (\~30%): - Spoken or written words

**Non-verbal Communication** (\~70%): - Facial expressions - Gestures - Posture - Eye contact - Tone of voice

# Models of Communication {#models-of-communication}

1.  **Linear Model** – One-way transmission (e.g., TV broadcast)

2.  **Interactive Model** – Sender ↔ Receiver with feedback (e.g. News blog)

3.  **Transactional Model** – Both parties simultaneously sender and receiver (e.g. Interview)

# Transactional Communication

Modern communication favors **transactional**, real-time exchange — especially in interpersonal and professional settings.

# Feedback in Communication {#feedback-in-communication}

Feedback can be: - **Intentional** (e.g., nodding to show understanding) - **Unintentional** (e.g., yawning from boredom)

# Feedback Examples

-   A student raising hand = intentional
-   Looking distracted = unintentional

Feedback helps the sender adjust or clarify the message.

# Effective Comm^n^

1.  **Source credibility** – Trustworthiness, expertise
2.  **Audience characteristics** – Age, education, values, needs
3.  **Channel availability** – Face-to-face, phone, email
4.  **Feedback mechanism** – Immediate or delayed, verbal or non-verbal
5.  **Message treatment** – Tailoring the message improves effectiveness.

# Message Organization

-   Organize your message logically:
-   Simple to complex
-   General to specific
-   Chronological (time-based)
-   Topical (theme-based)

# Message Appeals

Use persuasive appeals:

-   **Fear appeal**: Warns about negative consequences
-   **Reward appeal**: Shows benefits of action
-   **Emotional appeal**: Connects with feelings like love, guilt, pride
-   **Rational appeal**: Based on logic, facts, reasoning

# Channel {#selecting-the-right-communication-channel}

Depends on:

**Urgency**: Quick response?
→ Phone or face-to-face

**Message complexity**: Complex info → Written or visual aids

-   **Audience access**: Choose accessible medium
-   **Formality**:\
    → Formal = Email or letter\
    → Informal = Chat or call

Choose wisely to improve clarity and impact.

# Communication & Human Relations

Communication builds **human relationships** through:

-   Persuasion
-   Negotiation
-   Diplomacy
-   Dispute resolution

# Empathy in Communication
